## Background/About

### This was our final project as Front-End students at Turing School of Software and Design.  We were given 5 days to create an application using Vue, a completely new framework.  Designed to mimic an at-home code challenge given as part of a job-interview, students had to adapt from our largely React-based background to a similar, yet different, framework.
